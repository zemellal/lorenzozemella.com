The tools I use pretty much every day and would be hard to live without.

## Hardware

_MacBook Pro 14" 32GB_ is my main computer. It's incredibly powerful especially with the low power requirements of the M1 Pro chip. I absolutely love the display - it is extremely sharp with high color accuracy, and the variable 120Hz refresh is buttery smooth. Great feeling keyboard and trackpad, and more than enough connectivity to leave behind annoying hubs. Easy to travel with as it is a nice balance between the Air and the 16" MBP. At a desk, I prefer having a monitor for extended views. 

_iPhone 12 Pro_ still has enough battery life and the performance still feels cutting edge. We'll see what Apple releases this year! 

_AirPods Pro_ are used for hours every day. Even though the transparency mode works well, unless I'm listening to music, I feel more comfortable wearing only one earpiece for calls and podcasts. 

_Anker USB C Charger 40W, 521 (Nano Pro)_ is a compact 2 USB-C port charger that charges my phone as fast as it can. If I am traveling very light, I'll even leave behind the heavy 96W Apple brick and use the MagSafe cable to charge my laptop overnight.

## Software

_Zed_ has been my main editor since 2025. Loads extremely fast and has enough plugins and good AI agent and chat features. 

_1Password_ has been my password manager since 2015. I have a family plan and use it for more than just logins, i.e. passports, drivers license, bank accounts, and other secure notes. It is much easier to find your sensitive personal information when it's in one secure place. 

_Obsidian_ replaced the Apple Notes app for personal and work notes. I love the simplicity of Markdown with no vendor tie in at all. Everything is saved as a `.md` file (pure text). 

_Brave_ is my main browser. Feels faster than Chrome, especially with the built-in ad blocker. I'm all for supporting websites but most ads are intense resource hogs.  I also use Safari (has the smoothest scrolling), and Chrome when using anything Google.
